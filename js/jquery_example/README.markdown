jQuery Form Example Plugin 1.4.1
======================================

This is a jQuery plugin to populate form inputs with example text that
disappears on focus.

Basic usage revolves around the use of the `example` function like so:

    $('input#name').example('Bob Smith');

This will then put the example text "Bob Smith" into the input with the ID
"name". When a user then focuses on this input, the example text will
disappear, allowing them to enter their data. If they then click elsewhere
*without entering any information*, the example will re-appear.

By default, example text is given the class `example`, allowing you to style
it with CSS like so:

    .example { color: #666; }

If this class name conflicts with one you already use, you can override it
with the `className` option like so:

    $('input#name').example('Bob Smith', { className: 'hint' });

The above example would then be given the class `hint` instead of `example`.

If you plan to use the same options repeatedly, it is possible to override the
plugin's defaults directly:

    $.fn.example.defaults.className = 'notExample';

This will cause any uses of the plugin after this point to use the new
defaults.

As well as supplying the example text via a string, a callback function can be
used instead to determine the value at runtime:

    $('input#name').example(function() {
       return $(this).attr('title'); 
    });
    
The above example will set the example text to the `title` attribute of the
input. The callback is executed within the context of the input field so, as
in the example above, `$(this)` will return the input itself.

It is worth noting that the callback is evaluated every time the example text
needs to be inserted and *is not cached*. This makes it possible to
dynamically change the example text of a field after page load like so:

    $('input#name').example(function() {
        var text = $(this).attr('title');
        $(this).attr('title', 'Not the original title anymore');
        return text;
    });
    
The plugin also supports the jQuery Metadata plugin which allows you to 
specify metadata in elements themselves. You can specify the example text and
hide_label options like so:

    <input id="m1" class="{example: 'An example', className: 'abc' }" />

Please note that metadata will be overridden by arguments, e.g.

    <input id="m1" class="{example: 'An example'}" />
    $('#m1').example('Another example');

The example will be set to "Another example" instead of "An example".
