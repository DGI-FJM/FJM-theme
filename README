Requirements: Zen 2.0! You must have Zen 6.x-2.0 in your themes directory prior to enabling this theme. http://drupal.org/project/zen

Warning: Be sure no Zen 1.0 themes are in your working theme directory prior to using this theme, this will seriously break things.

IE stylesheet limit reminder: As there are many stylesheets in Zen2, there is a great possibility of exceeding the 31 stylesheet limit in IE when modules are added. When using the theme on production sites, be sure to enable the Optimize CSS Files option at /admin/settings/performance.
