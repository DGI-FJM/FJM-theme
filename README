Summary

The fjmtheme theme is a D6 Zen sub-theme that relies on the core components of Zen 2.x - http://drupal.org/project/zen

 * *Zen 2.x* is required to be in the themes directory along with your cairntheme sub theme

The cairntheme directory  in your theme folder is a sub-theme of Zen. This folder is actually the main template for all of the current cairntheme websites. The main template is basically all of the core style similarities of all of the sites, such as fixed width, margins, padding, sizes, etc. 

 * stylesheet breakdowns for the core template are here:  - http://drupal.org/node/1069786

Each of the websites then has it's own sub-sub-theme of the cairntheme, stored in the cairntheme folder by site name. The sub-sub-themes contain basic overrides such as color changes, header changes, etc. These sub-sub-themes are the only themes that should be modified for per site styling, if you modify the core template, all sites will be affected. 
 
 * Theme bugs, or overall feature additions should be addressed in the core theme. 

h3. Basic theme directory structure: 

 * sites/all/themes/
 ** zen (this is zen 2.x - required, should never be modified)
 ** FJM (sub-theme core template)

Most of the changes you would need to make can be handled via css, the css files you would use for specific site overrides are simply in the css folder.

example:  

 * FJM/css/*.css
 
A description of zen's stylesheets: http://drupal.org/node/1069786

More involved changes would be handled in the core template's templates/page.tpl.php (region locations & page structure) and preprocessor functions and hooks, etc would go in template.php
