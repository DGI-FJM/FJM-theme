Summary

The fjmtheme theme is a D6 Zen sub-theme that relies on the core components of Zen 2.x - http://drupal.org/project/zen

 * *Zen 2.x* is required to be in the themes directory along with your cairntheme sub theme

The cairntheme directory  in your theme folder is a sub-theme of Zen. This folder is actually the main template for all of the current cairntheme websites. The main template is basically all of the core style similarities of all of the sites, such as fixed width, margins, padding, sizes, etc. 

 * stylesheet breakdowns for the core template are here:  - http://drupal.org/node/1069786

Each of the websites then has it's own sub-sub-theme of the cairntheme, stored in the cairntheme folder by site name. The sub-sub-themes contain basic overrides such as color changes, header changes, etc. These sub-sub-themes are the only themes that should be modified for per site styling, if you modify the core template, all sites will be affected. 
 
 * Theme bugs, or overall feature additions should be addressed in the core theme. 

h3. Basic theme directory structure: 

 * sites/all/themes/
 ** zen (this is zen 2.x - required, should never be modified)
 ** FJM (sub-theme core template)

Most of the changes you would need to make can be handled via css, the css files you would use for specific site overrides are simply in the css folder.

example:  

 * FJM/css/*.css
 
Order And Purpose Of Default Stylesheets, for the most part this is very similar to Zen, with a few additional stylesheets and some modifications

html-reset.css:
    This is the place where you should set the default styling for all HTML elements and standardize the styling across browsers. 
layout-fixed.css:
    Zen's default layout is based on the Zen Columns layout method. The layout-fixed.css file contains all column and layout styling. 
page-backgrounds.css:
    Layered backgrounds across scattered divs can be easier to manage if they are centralized in one location.
tabs.css:
    tab styling, these tabs are css3 based and degrade gracefully for ie
messages.css: (Zen 6.x-2.x only)
    Styling for Drupal tabs and Drupal status messages.
pages.css:
    Page styling for the markup in the page.tpl.php template.
blocks.css:
    Block styling for the markup in the block.tpl.php template.
navigation.css:
    The styling for your site's menus can get quite bulky and its easier to see all the styles if they are grouped together rather then across the header/footer sections of pages.css and in blocks.css.
views-styles.css:
    Views styling for the markup in various views templates. You'll notice this stylesheet isn't called "views.css" as that would override (remove) the Views module's stylesheet.
nodes.css:
    Node styling for the markkup in the node.tpl.php template.
comments.css:
    Comment styling for the markup in the comment-wrapper.tpl.php and comments.tpl.php templates.
forms.css:
    Form styling for the markup in various Drupal forms, this also contains button styling. Since buttons are commonly used in forms, the code is located here. 
superfish.css
    Styling for dropdown menus in the primary link section, code here is integral for the related javascript to work, color styling should be placed in navigation.css
islandora.css
    Styling for islandora specific displays
jcarousel.css
    Overrides for the jcarousel jquery plugin
print.css:
    The print styles for all markup.
ie.css:
ie6.css:
    The Internet Explorer stylesheets are added via conditional comments. Many CSS authors find using IE "conditional stylesheets" much easier then writing rulesets with CSS hacks that are known to only apply to various versions of IE.

More involved changes would be handled in the core template's templates/page.tpl.php (region locations & page structure) and preprocessor functions and hooks, etc would go in template.php


h2. Detailed Notes

Here are the breakdown of the theme files in detail: 

 * *FJM/* - core template folder, considered a sub-theme to drupal
 ** *fjmtheme.info* - This defines regions, defines the core theme (zen), specifies js files and sets theme settings

 ** *css/* - all of the core css files are here
 ** *templates/* - content-type, view, block, page, node, etc template override locationdir, it falls back to this folder
